How to setup the submission interface

1. Create a new context (i.e. new folder in C:\Programme\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 6.0\webapps, like "ba")
2. Copy the contents of the WebContent folder into that folder
2a. Compile all java-files in src
2b. Copy all .class files to the webapps\[contextname]\WEB-INF/classes folder
3. Create a path where all submission should be stored (e.g. "c:\abgabesystem")
4. Copy submissiondir/* and SecurityManager/NoExitSecurityManager.jar to that folder
4a. If you want to use the JPlag plagiarism system (https://github.com/jplag/jplag), compile it into a single .jar (using the maven goal "assembly:assembly" inside the jplad directory and copy the final .jar (from the target folder) as "jplag.jar" into the root of the submissions folder.
5. Open web.xml in the webapps\[contextname]\WEB-INF-folder
5a. set the datapath value (context-param)
5b. If you want to use LDAP or any other login-method, update the filter-init-params of the AuthenticationFilter
5c. Set the number of parallell threads (cores) used by LocalExecuter
6. Create a new mysql database (like "abgabesystem", and a new user, recommended) and import mysql.sql
7. Open hibernate.cfg.xml in the webapps\[contextname]\WEB-INF\classes-folder
7a. Set the connection.username and connection.password (if you use another db, also update the driver_class)
7b. Update the connection.url, the value after the last slash must be the name of the created database.
8. Execute "util.CreateFirstUser" with parameters loginname, firtsname, lastname for creating a superuser-account.
9. Make sure the JAVA_HOME environment-variable points to the jre directory in a Java 1.6 JDK directory (required if you want to use the compile-tests)
10. Insert a scheduler entry for "util.DupeCheckRunner" (with the path to the submissions as the first parameter) whichs runs at certain times (with only one active instance) for automatically start the plagiarism check
11. On Debian-based systems, Tomcat might be sandboxed by systemd. Create a file /etc/systemd/system/tomcat9.service.d/gate.gate.conf containing: [Service], ReadWritePaths=/srv/submissioninterface/ (afterwards, issue systemctl daemon-reload)
12. Restart tomcat.
